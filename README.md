## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

- [ ] TikTok
     - Playing mini games on the app
     - A shop that sells a variety of different things
- [ ] theScore
     - Gives live scores of ALL sports
     - Gives updated news on all sport teams
- [ ] PS App
     - Provides information about PlayStation network on a mobile devices
     - Allows you to be in video game group chats that you can join on your phone
- [ ] Spotify
     - Recommend songs based on what you like
     - Notify you of new releases from your favorite artists
     - Allows background activity
     
I would like to make an app called PlayPal which would combine elements of gaming, social interaction, and personalized recommendations. The app will have mini-games and while the user is on the app, there will be background music, but the user can connect their spotify or apple music to it to have their favorite songs playing while playing the mini-games. These mini-games will be online allowing them to play with friends.
